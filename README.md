HTML5 Advertising Banner Framework
==================================

A framework for HTML5 advertising banners.

This framework uses __gulp-inject__ to inject CSS and JS directly into the html file.
Images are compressed with __gulp-imagemin__ and __pngquant__.

Requirements
------------

This framework requires node.js to work. I recommend installing it using [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).


Installation
------------

1. Update node. Used version v8.9.4. Or simply type `$ nvm use`. This will use the node version defined in *.nvmrc*.
2. Use `$ npm i` to install node dependencies.

Tasks
-----

1. `$ npm run build` Builds the project.
2. `$ npm run watch` or `$ npm start` Builds the project and watches for changes.
3. `$ npm run open` Opens all banners in browser.
